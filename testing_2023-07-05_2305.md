# ChatGPT Sentiment Analysis of Facebook Group Comments

# 1. Objective
Engaging with the public through social media is important to the success of many online businesses. While social media makes it easier than ever for the public to engage with businesses, small business owners already have a lot on their plate outside of responding to social media queries and comments. While analyzing written text can be automated through machine learning, this traditionally requires extensive resources that most individuals and small businesses do not have. 

ChatGPT can classify natural language data, a task that has traditionally required the the training and deployment of machine learning models.

The goal of this project is to **determine how well ChatGPT performs at text classification**. Specifically, I wanted to conceptually show whether **ChatGPT can improve the workflow of small businesses** that use social media. 

Here are the three tasks I asked ChatGPT to perform using comments posts in a Facebook group:
1. `sentiment`: Label the sentiment as "positive", "neutral", or "negative".
2. `emotion`: Identify the main emotion.
3. `respond`: Recommend whether or not the Facebook group administrator/business owner should quickly respond to the comment.


# 2. Methods

This project used the following:
* [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference)
* [LangChain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/api_reference.html#), which uses the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/overview)
* `scikit-learn` and `pandas`
* Jupyter Notebook extension in VSCode

## Step 1: Get Data from Facebook Group Posts

I retrieved the 30 most recent posts from a Facebook group associated with a an online personal training business (I have permission from the group administrator). This data included all the posts' comments (64 total top-level comments) and the replies to these comments.

If the comment had simply read "I love airlie beach just never find the time to go there anymore", then it would be reasonable to describe the commenter's main emotion as "disappointment". However, in this case, this line was more likely an after thought; the commenter was likely just noting a shared interest with the person who wrote the post.

# 4. Conclusion and Possible Future Directions
ChatGPT did a decent job at detecting sentiment and emotions, but had difficulty with discerning the meaning behind the words. However, it performed very well when given the specific task of determining whether or not the Facebook group administrator should respond to a comment. Perhaps ChatGPT can be most helpful when given sufficient context: The prompts for the sentiment and emotion tasks were not linked to a clear intent, unlike the "respond" task.

This was a fun proof-of-concept experiment to see if ChatGPT could be a good alternative to deploying a trained machine learning model. Based on these results, next time I would reflect more deeply about what I'd like ChatGPT to help me with and refine the work flow accordingly. Pragmatically, the low-hanging fruit would be to compare the results of different prompts.

Given the unbalanced data set, I would use different evaluation metrics depending on the specific intent of the work flow. For example:
* If I want a work flow that would be best at detecting negative sentiment/emotions so I can identify dissatisfied members/customers, I would likely use recall (sensitivity) as my evaluation metric, since there are fewer negative comments than positive.
* If I was looking for comments with highest level of excitement or gratitude so I can identify a handful of the biggest fans, I would consider using precision as my evaluation metric.

Of course, just because you CAN automate something, doesn't mean you should. Automations are most useful when there are too many messages than there are human resources. As these results show, ChatGPT is not a replacement for humans when it comes to understanding humans.
