       "      <td>[YOU] How I stay bikini confident year round 👙  First off I need to tell you - being bikini confident has actually NOTHING to do with how you look and everything to do with how you feel.  So let me tell you a little story…  Once upon a time I was a self conscious, controlling perfectionist who believed that being skinny and lean would make me happy.   I thought having abs and being lean were the definition of the perfect body.  And I embarked on a journey to achieve ‘perfection’.  I ended up exhausted, overwhelmed and disappointed 😔   I was unhappy - in a lot of elements of my life - so I decided to seek the help of a life coach. This was hard for me - as I’m a very strong independent woman so asking for help wasn’t easy. But let me tell you - hands down this changed my life.  After a very difficult time in my life, I chose to work with a counsellor (for a TOTALLY different reason).   So what has this got to do with me being happy in a bikini? 🤣  Seeking help from these people - changed my whole outlook on life. They helped me look internally and forced me to uncover some things I didn’t even know about myself.   My mindset towards myself changed. I stopped focusing on aesthetics as a goal and started working on performance. My relationship with food did a 360 and I started viewing food as fuel instead of calories in versus calories out. I started practising gratitude and meditating. I prioritised sleep instead of ‘grinding’.   And (for anyone who read the whole copy) that is how I am now bikini confident year round 👙  [MEMBER] Mind set is everything! Recently in Thailand, our last day. 12 hrs to kill before the flight, wanted to go for a swim, but didn’t want our baggage to weigh over the 25kg with wet swimmers (LOTS of shopping was done  lol) so my friend and I stripped off to our bra and undies walked the 5 metres across the decking and went swimming! 😂🤣 12 mths ago before meeting u, I would never have dreamed of doing this 🤣😂🤣 you only have one body, just learn to love it! ❤️ PS you look flipping amazballz!</td>\n",

Find a free online calculator- input your data - boom you’re done. Dream body here we come 🔥  But I think both you and I know it’s not that simple. Achieving long term sustainable fitness requires more than that.  But why?  Well firstly, we all need support and accountability of some form - even myself as a coach - I have coaches in business and health &amp; fitness! We all need that guidance to make sure what we’re currently doing is aligning with our goals. Someone to reach out to when we’re having a bad week? Or someone to share our success stories with 🙏   I believe knowledge is power. ‘Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish - you feed him for a lifetime’. Who doesn’t want to gain knowledge to last them a lifetime? 🎉  Nutrition is important and for fat loss it is vital. But it’s not the ONLY area that is important - if you’re neglecting sleep, exercising yourself into the ground with no techniques for stress management - watch as fat loss becomes a LOT harder.  But sure what do I know - I’m only a qualified nutritionist who’s helped 100s of women achieve countless body and mind transformations!  [MEMBER] So so true and this is what you do so well💕</td>\n",

Remember, it’s the accumulation of anything that is the problem. It’s never just one day or one drink. The same way one salad or one workout won’t make you healthy - it’s the accumulation over time.                     Is alcohol disrupting your routine? Is it causing you to miss every Monday? Is it causing poor food choices every Sunday?

You might just think it’s one drink every other night… but when you accumulate the negative affects it has, you’ll understand that frequency matters.                  #alcohol #isalcoholworthit #onlinecoach #fitnesscoach #transformation #realresults #realpeople #nutritionist #realnutrition  [MEMBER] Vicious 🤣</td>\n",

       "0   [YOU] How I stay bikini confident year round 👙  First off I need to tell you - being bikini confident has actually NOTHING to do with how you look and everything to do with how you feel.  So let me tell you a little story…  Once upon a time I was a self conscious, controlling perfectionist who believed that being skinny and lean would make me happy.   I thought having abs and being lean were the definition of the perfect body.  And I embarked on a journey to achieve ‘perfection’.  I ended up exhausted, overwhelmed and disappointed 😔   I was unhappy - in a lot of elements of my life - so I decided to seek the help of a life coach. This was hard for me - as I’m a very strong independent woman so asking for help wasn’t easy. But let me tell you - hands down this changed my life.  After a very difficult time in my life, I chose to work with a counsellor (for a TOTALLY different reason).   So what has this got to do with me being happy in a bikini? 🤣  Seeking help from these people - changed my whole outlook on life. They helped me look internally and forced me to uncover some things I didn’t even know about myself.   My mindset towards myself changed. I stopped focusing on aesthetics as a goal and started working on performance. My relationship with food did a 360 and I started viewing food as fuel instead of calories in versus calories out. I started practising gratitude and meditating. I prioritised sleep instead of ‘grinding’.   And (for anyone who read the whole copy) that is how I am now bikini confident year round 👙  [MEMBER] Mind set is everything! Recently in Thailand, our last day. 12 hrs to kill before the flight, wanted to go for a swim, but didn’t want our baggage to weigh over the 25kg with wet swimmers (LOTS of shopping was done  lol) so my friend and I stripped off to our bra and undies walked the 5 metres across the decking and went swimming! 😂🤣 12 mths ago before meeting u, I would never have dreamed of doing this 🤣😂🤣 you only have one body, just learn to love it! ❤️ PS you look flipping amazballz!   \n",

If you do - you’re not alone!!!!  This is something I hear REGULARLY! It starts with something like ‘Yea, but I can’t…  The reality is the women’s results that I post are EXACTLY like you.  ✅They are real women yielding real results. ✅They are busy - just like you!  ✅They are mothers - just like you!  ✅They face the same struggles - just like you!   So what is the REAL difference between them and you?  ✔️ They believe they can do it and then act.  It’s honestly that simple. They are the women who decided to take action. While you’re still making excuses - they’re working on themselves for themselves ❤️  So next time you see a transformation photo and think ‘Good for them but that will never be me…’ Sam thought exactly the same before she decided to take action. She’s now almost a stone down, with more energy and happier than ever 🙏  If you’re ready for your own transformation - click the link in my bio to submit your waitlist application ✌️  [MEMBER] I have Crohn’s disease and I have an ulcer on my bowel and I’m only 39 and just have been told that I have neuropathic pain   \n",

Find a free online calculator- input your data - boom you’re done. Dream body here we come 🔥  But I think both you and I know it’s not that simple. Achieving long term sustainable fitness requires more than that.  But why?  Well firstly, we all need support and accountability of some form - even myself as a coach - I have coaches in business and health & fitness! We all need that guidance to make sure what we’re currently doing is aligning with our goals. Someone to reach out to when we’re having a bad week? Or someone to share our success stories with 🙏   I believe knowledge is power. ‘Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish - you feed him for a lifetime’. Who doesn’t want to gain knowledge to last them a lifetime? 🎉  Nutrition is important and for fat loss it is vital. But it’s not the ONLY area that is important - if you’re neglecting sleep, exercising yourself into the ground with no techniques for stress management - watch as fat loss becomes a LOT harder.  But sure what do I know - I’m only a qualified nutritionist who’s helped 100s of women achieve countless body and mind transformations!  [MEMBER] So so true and this is what you do so well💕   \n",

It’s just one beer?                            But is it though?                       Remember, it’s the accumulation of anything that is the problem. It’s never just one day or one drink. The same way one salad or one workout won’t make you healthy - it’s the accumulation over time.                     Is alcohol disrupting your routine? Is it causing you to miss every Monday? Is it causing poor food choices every Sunday?                    One thing I can tell you for certain is it’s negatively impacting your sleep and your metabolic function - even just one glass 🙈.                             I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news….                                            And btw this is not coming from a pioneer….                                          I’ve been there. I’ve seen the implications it’s had not just on my goals but on my mental health and relationships….                              That’s why I’ve reduced my frequency. Frequency is important. You might just think it’s one drink every other night… but when you accumulate the negative affects it has, you’ll understand that frequency matters.                  #alcohol #isalcoholworthit #onlinecoach #fitnesscoach #transformation #realresults #realpeople #nutritionist #realnutrition  [MEMBER] Vicious 🤣   \n",
