# ChatGPT Sentiment Analysis of Facebook Group Comments

# 1. Objective
Engaging with the public through social media is important to the success of many online businesses. While social media makes it easier than ever for the public to engage with businesses, small business owners already have a lot on their plate outside of responding to social media queries and comments. While analyzing written text can be automated through machine learning, this traditionally requires extensive resources that most individuals and small businesses do not have. 

ChatGPT can classify natural language data, a task that has traditionally required the the training and deployment of machine learning models.

The goal of this project is to **determine how well ChatGPT performs at text classification**. Specifically, I wanted to conceptually show whether **ChatGPT can improve the workflow of small businesses** that use social media. 

Here are the three tasks I asked ChatGPT to perform using comments posts in a Facebook group:
1. `sentiment`: Label the sentiment as "positive", "neutral", or "negative".
2. `emotion`: Identify the main emotion.
3. `respond`: Recommend whether or not the Facebook group administrator/business owner should quickly respond to the comment.


# 2. Methods

This project used the following:
* [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference)
* [LangChain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/api_reference.html#), which uses the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/overview)
* `scikit-learn` and `pandas`
* Jupyter Notebook extension in VSCode

## Step 1: Get Data from Facebook Group Posts

I retrieved the 30 most recent posts from a Facebook group associated with a an online personal training business (I have permission from the group administrator). This data included all the posts' comments (64 total top-level comments) and the replies to these comments.

## Step 2: Selecting a Subset of Comments for Analysis
To limit the sample size for this mini experiment, I picked the longest comment for each post to include in analysis. Because not every post had comments, this left me with 19 comments to analyze.

    # Sort the dataframe by 'post_message' length in descending order
    df.sort_values(by='parent_comment_message', key=lambda x: x.str.len(), ascending=False, inplace=True)

      <td>You: How I stay bikini confident year round 👙\n\nFirst off I need to tell you - being bikini confident has actually NOTHING to do with how you look and everything to do with how you feel.\n\nSo let me tell you a little story…\n\nOnce upon a time I was a self conscious, controlling perfectionist who believed that being skinny and lean would make me happy. \n\nI thought having abs and being lean were the definition of the perfect body.\n\nAnd I embarked on a journey to achieve ‘perfection’.\n\nI ended up exhausted, overwhelmed and disappointed 😔 \n\nI was unhappy - in a lot of elements of my life - so I decided to seek the help of a life coach. This was hard for me - as I’m a very strong independent woman so asking for help wasn’t easy. But let me tell you - hands down this changed my life.\n\nAfter a very difficult time in my life, I chose to work with a counsellor (for a TOTALLY different reason). \n\nSo what has this got to do with me being happy in a bikini? 🤣\n\nSeeking help from these people - changed my whole outlook on life. They helped me look internally and forced me to uncover some things I didn’t even know about myself. \n\nMy mindset towards myself changed. I stopped focusing on aesthetics as a goal and started working on performance. My relationship with food did a 360 and I started viewing food as fuel instead of calories in versus calories out. I started practising gratitude and meditating. I prioritised sleep instead of ‘grinding’. \n\nAnd (for anyone who read the whole copy) that is how I am now bikini confident year round 👙\n\nMember: Mind set is everything! Recently in Thailand, our last day. 12 hrs to kill before the flight, wanted to go for a swim, but didn’t want our baggage to weigh over the 25kg with wet swimmers (LOTS of shopping was done  lol) so my friend and I stripped off to our bra and undies walked the 5 metres across the decking and went swimming! 😂🤣 12 mths ago before meeting u, I would never have dreamed of doing this 🤣😂🤣 you only have one body, just learn to love it! ❤️\nPS you look flipping amazballz!</td>

Dream body here we come 🔥\n\nBut I think both you and I know it’s not that simple. Achieving long term sustainable fitness requires more than that.\n\nBut why? \nWell firstly, we all need support and accountability of some form - even myself as a coach - I have coaches in business and health &amp; fitness! We all need that guidance to make sure what we’re currently doing is aligning with our goals. Someone to reach out to when we’re having a bad week?

I’ve seen the implications it’s had not just on my goals but on my mental health and relationships….                              That’s why I’ve reduced my frequency. Frequency is important. You might just think it’s one drink every other night… but when you accumulate the negative affects it has, you’ll understand that frequency matters.                  #alcohol #isalcoholworthit #onlinecoach #fitnesscoach #transformation #realresults #realpeople #nutritionist #realnutrition\n\nMember: Vicious 🤣</td>

## Step 3. Seek ChatGPT's Wisdom using LangChain
`LangChain` provides libraries that facilitate use of the ChatGPT API. One useful tool is their prompt templates, which allow you to easily swap out one part of the prompt (e.g. the text to analyze, as indicated by `{}`) while keeping the main instructions constant. 

Here are the prompt templates I used to generate my final responses:

Task | Prompt Template
--- | ---
sentiment | You are the owner of a personal training business. You use a Facebook group to as a lead generation tool. You write posts in the group to engage with members and position yourself as a coach who can help them achieve their fitness goals. You aim to respond quickly to comments by group members if they request information, express a desire to improve their fitness, have health conditions or injuries, or express dissatisfaction with their current fitness. Below, delimited by triple back ticks, is a post you wrote in the group and a comment from a member:, Determine the sentiment of the member comment as "positive", "neutral", or "negative". ```{text}``` If you are not sure of the answer, return "?"
emotion | You are the owner of a personal training business. You use a Facebook group to as a lead generation tool. You write posts in the group to engage with members and position yourself as a coach who can help them achieve their fitness goals. You aim to respond quickly to comments by group members if they request information, express a desire to improve their fitness, have health conditions or injuries, or express dissatisfaction with their current fitness. Below, delimited by triple back ticks, is a post you wrote in the group and a comment from a member:, Determine the main emotion expressed in the member comment. Return your response as a single word. ```{text}``` If you are not sure of the answer, return "?"

      <td>[YOU] How I stay bikini confident year round 👙  First off I need to tell you - being bikini confident has actually NOTHING to do with how you look and everything to do with how you feel.  So let me tell you a little story…  Once upon a time I was a self conscious, controlling perfectionist who believed that being skinny and lean would make me happy.   I thought having abs and being lean were the definition of the perfect body.  And I embarked on a journey to achieve ‘perfection’.  I ended up exhausted, overwhelmed and disappointed 😔   I was unhappy - in a lot of elements of my life - so I decided to seek the help of a life coach. This was hard for me - as I’m a very strong independent woman so asking for help wasn’t easy. But let me tell you - hands down this changed my life.  After a very difficult time in my life, I chose to work with a counsellor (for a TOTALLY different reason).   So what has this got to do with me being happy in a bikini? 🤣  Seeking help from these people - changed my whole outlook on life. They helped me look internally and forced me to uncover some things I didn’t even know about myself.   My mindset towards myself changed. I stopped focusing on aesthetics as a goal and started working on performance. My relationship with food did a 360 and I started viewing food as fuel instead of calories in versus calories out. I started practising gratitude and meditating. I prioritised sleep instead of ‘grinding’.   And (for anyone who read the whole copy) that is how I am now bikini confident year round 👙  [MEMBER] Mind set is everything! Recently in Thailand, our last day. 12 hrs to kill before the flight, wanted to go for a swim, but didn’t want our baggage to weigh over the 25kg with wet swimmers (LOTS of shopping was done  lol) so my friend and I stripped off to our bra and undies walked the 5 metres across the decking and went swimming! 😂🤣 12 mths ago before meeting u, I would never have dreamed of doing this 🤣😂🤣 you only have one body, just learn to love it! ❤️ PS you look flipping amazballz!</td>

So what is the REAL difference between them and you?  ✔️ They believe they can do it and then act.  It’s honestly that simple. They are the women who decided to take action.

Well firstly, we all need support and accountability of some form - even myself as a coach - I have coaches in business and health &amp; fitness! We all need that guidance to make sure what we’re currently doing is aligning with our goals. Someone to reach out to when we’re having a bad week? Or someone to share our success stories with 🙏   I believe knowledge is power. ‘Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, teach him how to fish - you feed him for a lifetime’. Who doesn’t want to gain knowledge to last them a lifetime? 🎉  Nutrition is important and for fat loss it is vital. But it’s not the ONLY area that is important - if you’re neglecting sleep, exercising yourself into the ground with no techniques for stress management - watch as fat loss becomes a LOT harder.  But sure what do I know - I’m only a qualified nutritionist who’s helped 100s of women achieve countless body and mind transformations!  [MEMBER] So so true and this is what you do so well💕</td>

I’ve seen the implications it’s had not just on my goals but on my mental health and relationships….                              That’s why I’ve reduced my frequency. Frequency is important. You might just think it’s one drink every other night… but when you accumulate the negative affects it has, you’ll understand that frequency matters.                  #alcohol #isalcoholworthit #onlinecoach #fitnesscoach #transformation #realresults #realpeople #nutritionist #realnutrition  [MEMBER] Vicious 🤣</td>

## Compare My Answers with ChatGPT's 

At first glance, ChatGPT's responses looked pretty good. To quantify ChatGPT's accuracy at the task on hand, we need to know "ground truth"; thus:
* I labelled each post-comment pair myself for the "sentiment" and "respond" tasks (the "emotion task" is too open-ended). 
* I did a simple exploratory data analysis to look at the class distributions of these ground-truth labels.
* I used `scikit-learn` to determine ChatGPT's accuracy and produce a confusion matrix for each of the 2 tasks.

From the bar chart above, you see that most comments (63.16%) have positive sentiment and that most comments (68.42%) do not require a fast response.


### Sentiment Task
For the basic sentiment analysis task, ChatGPT had a 73.7% accuracy: 5 out of 18 of its classifications differed from mine (though to be fair, not all comments fell neatly into one bucket).

This metric may seem okay at first, but looking more closely at the results, you can see that in all but 2 of the 19 cases, ChatGPT rated the sentiment as "positive". Based on my "ground-truth" labelling, simply guessing "positive" sentiment to every comment would have been correct 63% of the time without a need to read the text. This means that ChatGPT may have lacked:
* the sensitivity to detect messages of negative sentiment.
* the ability to differentiate between neutral and positive sentiment.

Below is the one case where ChatGPT and I didn't agree in relation to the "respond" task.

        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">

      <th>respond</th>
    </tr>

Sure, it would be nice to respond with something along the lines of "you're welcome", but this was not crucial as indicated the context provided in the prompt:
> You aim to respond quickly to comments by group members if they request information, express a desire to improve their fitness, have health conditions or injuries, or express dissatisfaction with their current fitness.

### Emotion Detection
ChatGPT performed decently a lot of the time when asked to interpret emotion from text, but seems to take words literally, missing subtle nuances. For example, take text #18:



<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```Python
results_dict[iteration].loc[18:18, ['text', 'emotions']]
```
</details>



<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>text</th>
      <th>emotions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>18</th>
      <td>[YOU] Ah but it’s just a glass of wine….    It’s just one beer?                            But is it though?                       Remember, it’s the accumulation of anything that is the problem. It’s never just one day or one drink. The same way one salad or one workout won’t make you healthy - it’s the accumulation over time.                     Is alcohol disrupting your routine? Is it causing you to miss every Monday? Is it causing poor food choices every Sunday?                    One thing I can tell you for certain is it’s negatively impacting your sleep and your metabolic function - even just one glass 🙈.                             I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news….                                            And btw this is not coming from a pioneer….                                          I’ve been there. I’ve seen the implications it’s had not just on my goals but on my mental health and relationships….                              That’s why I’ve reduced my frequency. Frequency is important. You might just think it’s one drink every other night… but when you accumulate the negative affects it has, you’ll understand that frequency matters.                  #alcohol #isalcoholworthit #onlinecoach #fitnesscoach #transformation #realresults #realpeople #nutritionist #realnutrition  [MEMBER] Vicious 🤣</td>
      <td>Frustration</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



The literal meaning of "vicious" has a negative tone, but in this context, it is evident that the commenter is joking: They don't actually think that the person who wrote the post is mean, just that the poster is reminding them about the unfortunate truth about something people enjoy.


Here's another example where ChatGPT was likely wrong about the main emotion:


<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```Python
results_dict[iteration].loc[5:5, ['text', 'emotions']]
```
</details>



<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>text</th>
      <th>emotions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>[YOU] Greetings team from Airlie Beach 👋  Reminder there will be no weekly live training next week as I am on holidays 🙏  I’m curious - have you any holidays planned this year?  [MEMBER] You are less than 2 hours away from where I am thats so cool I love airlie beach just never find the time to go there anymore</td>
      <td>Disappointment</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



If the comment had simply read "I love airlie beach just never find the time to go there anymore", then it would be reasonable to describe the commenter's main emotion as "disappointment". However, in this case, this line was more likely an after thought; the commenter was likely just noting a shared interest with the person who wrote the post.

# 4. Conclusion and Possible Future Directions
ChatGPT did a decent job at detecting sentiment and emotions, but had difficulty with discerning the meaning behind the words. However, it performed very well when given the specific task of determining whether or not the Facebook group administrator should respond to a comment. Perhaps ChatGPT can be most helpful when given sufficient context: The prompts for the sentiment and emotion tasks were not linked to a clear intent, unlike the "respond" task.

This was a fun proof-of-concept experiment to see if ChatGPT could be a good alternative to deploying a trained machine learning model. Based on these results, next time I would reflect more deeply about what I'd like ChatGPT to help me with and refine the work flow accordingly. Pragmatically, the low-hanging fruit would be to compare the results of different prompts.

Given the unbalanced data set, I would use different evaluation metrics depending on the specific intent of the work flow. For example:
* If I want a work flow that would be best at detecting negative sentiment/emotions so I can identify dissatisfied members/customers, I would likely use recall (sensitivity) as my evaluation metric, since there are fewer negative comments than positive.
* If I was looking for comments with highest level of excitement or gratitude so I can identify a handful of the biggest fans, I would consider using precision as my evaluation metric.

Of course, just because you CAN automate something, doesn't mean you should. Automations are most useful when there are too many messages than there are human resources. As these results show, ChatGPT is not a replacement for humans when it comes to understanding humans.
